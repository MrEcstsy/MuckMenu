1. **Install BepInEx**:
   - Download the [BepInEx x64 version](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/tag/v5.4.23.2) (make sure it's the 64-bit version).
   - Extract it into your Muck game folder (where `Muck.exe` is).
   - Run the game once to let BepInEx set itself up.
   - You should now see a `BepInEx/plugins/` folder.

2. **Install this mod**:
   - Download the compiled `.dll` file from the [Releases page](https://github.com/MrEcstsy/MuckMenu/releases) *(replace with your actual link)*.
   - Place the `.dll` inside the `BepInEx/plugins/` folder.

3. **Launch the game**:
   - Once in-game, press `F1` to toggle the menu.
